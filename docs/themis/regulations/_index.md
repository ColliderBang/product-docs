## Themis and GDPR/HIPAA/CCPA    

Themis can help you reach better compliance with the current data privacy regulations, such as     
 
* [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/)   
* [HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act)        
* [DPA (Data Protection Act)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted)     
* [CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act)    

As a cryptographic services library for mobile and server platforms, Themis is a ["state of the art"](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-32-gdpr/) encryption tool, which provides secure data exchange and storage. 

To find out about the exact ways Themis can help secure the users' data in your product(s)/infrastructure, apply for the [Customer Success Program](https://www.cossacklabs.com/services/customer-success-program/).

## Cryptographic regulations

The country in which you currently reside may have restrictions on the import, possession, use, and/or re-export to another country, of encryption software. BEFORE using any encryption software, please check your country's laws, regulations, and policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to see if this is permitted. See http://www.wassenaar.org/ for more information.

The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes information security software using or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric algorithms. The form and manner of this distribution make it eligible for export under the License Exception ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object code and source code.

## Submitting application to App Store

If you’re using Themis as your means of encryption within your iOS/macOS app that you’re submitting to the App Store, your encryption falls under the “open source” exception (although if your app is not open source/distributed free of charge, we strongly recommend that you seek legal advice). 

This means that you should indicate that you’re using encryption and only submit annual self-classification reports. Read this chapter about [submitting applications with Themis to App Store](/docs/themis/regulations/apple-crypto-regulations/).
