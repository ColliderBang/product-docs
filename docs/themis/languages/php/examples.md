# Example projects with PHPThemis

Once you have [installed PHPThemis](../installation), itâ€™s time to give it some action!

Some code samples for Themis features are available at
[`docs/examples/php`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/php)
on GitHub:

  - Secure Cell API showcase
  - message encryption using Secure Message
  - a simple chat server and client using Secure Session

There are [command-line utilities](/docs/themis/debugging/cli-utilities#go-console-utils)
that you can run from GitHub source code
at [`tools/php`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tools/php).

[Themis Server examples](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/Themis-server/php)
can be used with [Themis Interactive Simulator](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/simulator/interactive/):
you can generate the keys and simulate whole client-server communication.
Read more in the [Themis Server guide](/docs/themis/debugging/themis-server).

You can also take a look at unit tests in [PHPThemis source code](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tests/phpthemis).
