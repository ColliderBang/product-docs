# Example projects with JsThemis

Once you have [installed JsThemis](../installation), itâ€™s time to give it some action!

Some code samples for Themis features are available at
[`docs/examples/js` on GitHub](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/js):

  - key generation utilities
  - Secure Cell API showcase
  - message encryption using Secure Message
  - a simple chat server and client using Secure Session
  - password authentication using Secure Comparator

There are [command-line utilities](/docs/themis/debugging/cli-utilities#go-console-utils)
that you can run with `node` from GitHub source code
at [`tools/js/jsthemis`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tools/js/jsthemis).

You can also take a look at unit tests in [JsThemis source code](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/src/wrappers/themis/jsthemis/test).

[Read the feature guide](../features)
in order to learn how to use Themis effectively with Node.js.
