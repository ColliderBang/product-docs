# Example projects with RustThemis

Once you have [installed RustThemis](../installation), itâ€™s time to give it some action!

Some code samples for Themis features are available at
[`docs/examples/rust`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/rust)
on GitHub:

  - key generation utilities
  - data encryption using Secure Cell
  - a simple chat server and client using Secure Message and Secure Session

There are [command-line utilities](/docs/themis/debugging/cli-utilities#rust-console-utils)
which you can `cargo run` from GitHub source code
at [`tools/rust`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tools/rust).

You can also take a look at unit tests
in [RustThemis source code](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tests/rust).

[Read the feature guide](../features)
in order to learn how to use Themis effectively in Go.
