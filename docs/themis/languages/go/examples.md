# Example projects with GoThemis

Once you have [installed GoThemis](../installation), itâ€™s time to give it some action!

Some code samples for Themis features are available at
[`docs/examples/go` on GitHub](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/go):

  - Secure Cell API showcase
  - key generation utilities
  - message encryption using Secure Message
  - a simple chat server and client using Secure Session
  - password authentication using Secure Comparator

There are [command-line utilities](/docs/themis/debugging/cli-utilities#go-console-utils)
that you can `go run` from GitHub source code
at [`tools/go`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tools/go).

[Themis Server examples](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/Themis-server/go)
can be used with [Themis Interactive Simulator](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/simulator/interactive/):
you can generate the keys and simulate whole client-server communication.
Read more in the [Themis Server guide](/docs/themis/debugging/themis-server).

You can also take a look at unit tests in [GoThemis source code](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/gothemis).

[Read the feature guide](../features)
in order to learn how to use Themis effectively in Go.
